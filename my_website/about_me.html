        <h1> About Me </h1>
        <br>
        <h2> Interests and Hobbies </h2>
            <p>  Some things that interest me is singing. I have been singing ever since i was lttle. Another thing i like to do is
             come up with choreography for dances and show the dances to my cousins and then we do the 
             dance in front of my aunt and uncles, i love to dance even if i'm not so good at it, i dont dance to impress i dance for me.I also love school so much, i love  to learn new things. My favorite subjects in 
            school is english and science. I like english because i like to read and write essays, and i like science because i like
            to learn about the body and do cool expeiriments. </p>
            
        <h2> When I Grow Up </h2>
            <p>  Another reason i like science would be because it has to do with what i want to be when i grow up, which is to be a
            pediatrician or a OB-GYN. To become any of those things in neen to do good in science and understand it. That is my 
            plan A, my plan B is to be a english teacher for an elementary school, and my final plan is plan C which is to be a hair
            styles. The reaon i want to be a child doctor is because i love to take care of children like my cousins. </p>
